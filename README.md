# Retail-Store-Visualization-BSYS2100-

Introduction
This project aims to create compelling data visualizations using Power Pivot on your team’s existing data model in Excel. The data model consists of sales data for your team’s small retail store, including information about customers, orders, products, categories, sales, and order items. You will use Excel to create various visualizations that will help stakeholders gain insights into the company's sales performance and make informed decisions.
Data Model
You will use the Data Model that your team designed for the first Group Project. Any functional changes needed based on feedback from the previous project should be implemented at this stage to make the Data Model suitable for this project. Refer to the previous project and feedback to inform your decisions on this project. Note that you may (and likely will) add data to the existing tables to enable sufficient reporting detail in this project.
Calculated Fields
You will build on the data stored in the Model by creating calculated fields to summarize and enhance the data on reports. Your team will create the following calculated fields in Excel Pivot Table/Charts:
1. Total Sales: A sum of all the sales (which will be split by categories on the dashboard).
2. Total Revenue: A sum of all the revenue generated from sales (split by categories).
3. Average Revenue per Order: The average revenue generated per order.
4. Profit Margin: The percentage of profit generated from sales.
Types of Visualization
You will use at least four different visualizations to represent various aspects of the data. The following list items are suggestions of possible visualizations (you may choose others that you feel are appropriate):
1. Bar Chart: To represent the total sales by product category.
2. Line Chart: To represent the trend of sales over time.
3. Map: To represent the distribution of sales by location.
4. Tree Diagram: To represent the total revenue by customer.
Centralized Excel Report Dashboard
You will create a centralized dashboard that will include all the visualizations you created. The dashboard will be designed in a user-friendly manner to ensure that stakeholders can easily access and interpret the data. It will also include slicers to enable users to interact with the data and gain more insights.
Rationale
The reporting dashboard aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the company's sales performance using Excel. These visualizations should be designed to help stakeholders make informed decisions that will drive the company's growth and success.
Deliverables
You should submit the following deliverables:
1. A written explanation of your design changes (if any) and any data additions you made during the design process. This should be no more than 750 words.
2. The updated data source files
a. An Excel file (the “Excel Data”) that includes the updated raw data for the Customers, Products, and Categories data (Do not simply update the Access data tables; source data in Excel must be changed, and these changes used to update the Access data).
b. An Access database that includes tables for each model entity.
3. A Model workbook containing Power Query scripts that load the data from Access into Excel (the “Excel Model”) and build the data model. These Power Query scripts will contain any transformation steps necessary to enable the calculated values requested above.
4. A set of consolidated data visualizations contained in the Model workbook that summarize the data in the model in a meaningful way using Pivot Table/Charts as needed.
